a. i. Each Comment is a separate self-contained element (modularity)
that receives its information from the containing structure (stateless).
The CommentList class provides modular and stateless access to multiple comments.
The CommentBox and CommentForm classes are not stateless but they are modular
and they refresh their state frequently from the server.

It is important that the application is composable first because the size of the
comment list changes dynamically depending on the server and also because it
enables the possibility to re-order modular elements such as the CommentBox and
CommentForm, or to re-use the CommentList class in a new class if the requirements
change (IE ReplyBox)

a. ii. JSX is an XML like Syntax used in React to specify rendered components.
It is compiled into JavaScript. It is useful because it resembles HTML and gives
a clearer picture of what the end result will look like from an HTML perspective.
(It more closely resembles the DOM than JavaScript would)

a.iii. When the script runs, it renders a new CommentBox. A CommentBox contains
two structures: the CommentList and the CommentForm. Both of these have a state.
The CommentBox initializes the data in its state as empty. Every two seconds the
CommentBox makes an Ajax call to refresh its state with data from the server.
CommentBox provides a callback function to CommentFrom that will refresh the state
of CommentBox when CommentForm is submitted. The CommentList is populated from
state data of the CommentBox.

a.iv. Props are immutable, while states are mutable. A React class can change its
own state but not its own properties. However, a parent class may update the
 properties of its child elements, as in the case of the CommentBox updating the
  properties of the CommentList. The distinction is important because properties
  enable stateless behavior while states facilitate communication of data with the
  server.

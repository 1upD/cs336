Static files are static in that they cannot change dynamically the way that a web page can. The files can only be changed if they are changed remotely and redownloaded when the page is refreshed.

The server continues to serve up hello world messages. When you access the port, it still serves the hello world message. The static files are accessed through the /static/ path.
